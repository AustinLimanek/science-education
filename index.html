                Science is a tool to better understand and communicate the feeling of <em><strong>awe</strong></em> that we get when we look up at the stars in the night sky. <br>

            <h2>Physics</h2>
            <img src="images/physics.png" width="250"/>
            <p>
                Physics is the most fundamental of the sciences. Its origins are tied closely with the development of mathematics, philosphy, <br>
                and the development of technology. Everything around you will be enriched with a fuller understanding of physics: from what <br>
                you see, touch, hear, and feel. The atoms that make up all the material around us can be modeled using electricity and magnetism, <br>
                quantum mechanics, and other more technical theories. Physics also describes that paths of planets, stars, black holes, and <br>
                supernove.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's true, mathematics is used heavily to communicate ideas within physics. However, you can understand physics at an intuitive <br>
                level if you do experiments and ask questions about what you see. Math is used to <em>help</em> communicate, which means it isn't the <br> 
                the only may to communicate.
            </p>
            <h3>Who is a physicist?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Experimentors at international labs such as CERN</li>
                <li>Researchers at universities and colleges around the world</li>
                <li>Astronomers who look up at the stars</li>
                <li><em>YOU</em> when you ask questions about the world around you</li>

        <section id="chemistry">
            <h2>Chemistry</h2>
            <img src="images/chemistry.png" width="300"/>
            <p>
                Chemistry is the language to describe how elements and molecules interact with other particle like objects and their environment.<br>
                The periodic table of elements is the central concept in introductory chemistry. There are roughly 100 elements that are stable <br>
                on earth's biosphere. Some elements, if isolated, can react violently by just being exposed to the air around us. Some elements <br>
                are so stable that it takes very particular conditions to force them to react/interact with other particle like objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elements, as a concept, exist to organize the different ways atoms interact. Atoms have two basic components: electrons and the <br>
                nucleus. Furthermore, the nucleus is composed of both protons and neutrons. Hydrogen, the most basic element (or atom), is an <br>
                exception and can have only a proton making up its nucleus.
            </p>
            <h3>Who is a chemist?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chemical Engineers</li>
                <li>Doctors who research vaccines</li>
                <li>Material scientists that engineer plastics, metals, and fabrics</li>
                <li><em>YOU</em> when you ask questions about how liquids, gases, and solids will change when you change the environment around them</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="biology">
            <h2>Biology</h2>
            <img src="images/biology.jpg" width="300" height="150"/>
            <p>Biology is the language of how chemistry and physics comes together to construct structure in living organisms. Large molecules <br>
                called proteins, lipids, RNA, and DNA make up the building blocks of cells, tissues, and organs. Although there are <em>many</em> 
                other molecules <br> that make up organisms, these are the major building blocks of life on Earth - and possibly other locations in the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Biology is also where the study of medicine has its roots. In the subfield biochemistry, the study of virsus, bacterium, and animals <br>
                (which includes humans) provides the language to discuss pathogens, disease, and medicines. There are other subfields such as: <br>
                genetics, which studies DNA; virology, which studies viruses; neurology, which studies nerve tissue; and <em>many</em>, <strong>many</strong> others!

            <ul>
                <li>Neuro surgeons</li>
                <li>Veterinarians who treat your pets</li>
                <li>Ecologist who study the way species interact with their ecosystems and environment</li>
                <li><em>YOU</em> when you ask questions about your health, your heritage, and your environment</li>

        <section id="geology">
            <h2>Geology</h2>
            <img src="images/geology.jpg" width="300"/>
            <p>
                Geology has its roots on Earth, along with all the sciences thus established. However, planetary geology is the study of objects <br>
                throughout our solar system, and beyond. Geo means earth, and is derived from greek.
